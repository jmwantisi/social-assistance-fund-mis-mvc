# Social Assistance Fund MIS 

## Project Overview
Ministry of Labour and Social Protection (MoGLSD) is in the process of establishing a Social Assistance Fund. The Social Protection Fund will consolidate monetary resources from state and non-state actors with the aim of disbursing it to the needy and vulnerable persons on a timely and predictable manner. The applicants will be identified on demand basis and assessed based on determination of their vulnerability and income status. An applicant can apply for one or more social assistance programmes. Once eligibility has been determined, then the applicants will be informed by email or through SMS alerts.

On a side note: This an alternative build (this includes improvements in workflows also)from previous work: 
  - [SpringBoot + SpringJPA API](https://github.com/jmwantisi/SocialAssistanceFundApiV1)
  - [Vue3JS Client](https://github.com/jmwantisi/socialAssistanceFundWebApp)


This project is a .NET Core application for managing the Social Assistance Fund. It includes various features like managing applications, applicants, and sending notifications via email.

> ðŸ†• **This build uses Blazor Server** for the frontend interface, offering a more seamless and integrated experience within the .NET ecosystem. Compared to the previous Vue 3 SPA, Blazor allows for full-stack development using C#, real-time interactivity, and simplified deployment with fewer moving parts. It also improves performance for internal environments where low-latency interactivity is critical.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [.NET 6.0 SDK or higher](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or any other compatible database)

  git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
  cd your-repository
```

## Configuration Steps

### Database Configuration

1. **Connection String:**
   The connection string for the database needs to be set in your `appsettings.json` file.

   Example for SQL Server:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=SocialAssistanceFundDB;User Id=yourUsername;Password=yourPassword;"
     }
   }
2. **Email Service Configuration**
   Configure Email Settings: The project uses the MailKit library for sending emails.
   In order to configure the email service, you need to set up the SMTP server and credentials in the EmailService class.
   - Replace the smtpServer, smtpPort, smtpUsername, and smtpPassword with your own SMTP details.
   - Ensure the fromEmail and fromName are set to the email from which notifications will be sent.
   ```
     public class EmailService : IEmailService
      {
          private readonly string smtpServer = "smtp-relay.brevo.com";
          private readonly int smtpPort = 587;
          private readonly string smtpUsername = "89b417002@smtp-brevo.com";
          private readonly string smtpPassword = "QtIKX107kpHBS62N";
      
          private readonly string fromEmail = "89b417001@smtp-brevo.com";
          private readonly string fromName = "SOCIAL ASSISTANCE FUND";
      
          public async Task SendEmailAsync(string toEmail, string subject, string htmlMessage)
          {
              var email = new MimeMessage();
              email.From.Add(new MailboxAddress(fromName, fromEmail));
              email.To.Add(MailboxAddress.Parse(toEmail));
              email.Subject = subject;
              email.Body = new TextPart(MimeKit.Text.TextFormat.Html)
              {
                  Text = htmlMessage
              };
      
              using var smtp = new SmtpClient();
              await smtp.ConnectAsync(smtpServer, smtpPort, SecureSocketOptions.StartTls);
              await smtp.AuthenticateAsync(smtpUsername, smtpPassword);
              await smtp.SendAsync(email);
              await smtp.DisconnectAsync(true);
          }
      }
   ```
